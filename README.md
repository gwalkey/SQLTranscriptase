# SQLTranscriptase 
<h2>Creating SQL Server Documentation using Powershell</h2>

These Powershell scripts allow both the beginning and experienced Powershell student and DBA both<br>
to learn Powershell and preserve SQL Server objects that comprise your On-Prem and Azure Servers.

They capture and export all SQL-Server related objects both inside and outside the database. As well as <br>
anything you cant access in SSMS by doing a "Right-click" Script-Out action.<br>

The Scripts are designed to be run separately or together. The default parameters run the scripts against [localhost].<br>
The Powershell script <b>00_RunAllScripts.ps1</b> runs most of the individual scripts in a pre-defined sequence to export<br>
most objects. But because the scripts are individual scripts, you are free to run or assemble them to your liking.<br>

The scripts use 3 MS Technologies to export their data:
1) TSQL
2) SMO - SQL Server Management Objects
3) WMI

They assume SysAdmin or equivalent permissions on the SQL Boxes you plan to script-out.

Please read the Wiki above for setup instructions as the scripts have MS dependencies that change frequently
